# Blockchain Fundamentals

This repository simulates a single node basic blockchain running in a collection in mongodb. The purpose of this app is to demonstrate how blocks are added and the chain validated.

## Prerequisites

- Install docker and Docker Compose

## Setup

- Run `yarn` to install node modules

## Installing the a Blockchain

- Running the command `npm run blockchain:init -- -d` creates a json file on the blockchain folder and a Genesis block. You can add a value at the end of the command between 1 and 64, this determines the difficulty level for finding a hash, 1 being the hardest.
