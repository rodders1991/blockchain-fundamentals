This repository demonstrates a basic blockchain, the blockchain is saved in a json file from within the `blockchain` folder.

## Prerequisites

- Please install npm => 3.10
- Then install the required global dependencies using npm; `npm install -g yarn`

## Installing the a Blockchain

- Running the command `npm run blockchain:init -- -d` creates a json file on the blockchain folder and a Genesis block. You can add a value at the end of the command between 1 and 64, this determines the difficulty level for finding a hash, 1 being the hardest.
